## Description 
This week I was tasked with building the backend of an e-commerce site utilizing the provided starter code. There is so much going on! Look at all the folders and files we have now! This Challenge has been very insightful as I've been struggling with routes, fortunately I have been getting the hang of it more and more with this challenge! The sequelize models and CRUD operation and endpoints are also pretty fun to code as well and Sequelize makes it so much easier than writing raw mySQL. With sequelize models, Iâ€™ve defined the columns for the tables we will be utilizing. And with insomnia, we'll be able to interact with the database by using the different operators and endpoints! We will be able to read, create, update, or delete the categories, tags, or products with this application. It's pretty cool and starting to come together!
